I think that you should look into contour plots and the quiver function to illustrate you potential and fields. I think you also have to do the disk and the MATLAB equivalents. I would also like you to look into using the array operations that python and MATLAB offers, it could save a few for loops (that are very computationally expensive.)

Wow, I took too long to respond to the updates. I'm happy with the MATLAB programs with two comments: (1) more comments - you'll forget what this program does if you don't include comments (2) you should make sure that you can produce more refined (higher resolution) equipotential surfaces, right now they are somewhat boxy.
